This is the template I use for my resume and cover letter. I haven't bothered putting it up on Typst, so if you want to use it, you need to save it locally. For Linux, save it in ~/.cache/typst/packages/preview. (Note that it wasn't working for me to use the @local option, for whatever reason.) See [this](https://github.com/typst/packages?tab=readme-ov-file#local-packages) for more.

You can adjust the variables at the top as you see fit.

Note: I wrote a little bash script that adjusts the file, and so, in case you wish to export the resume to .md (which could be useful for jobs that require text-only resumes).
