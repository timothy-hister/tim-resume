This is the template I use for my resume and cover letter. I haven't bothered putting it up on Typst, so if you want to use it, you need to save it locally. For Linux, save it in ~/.cache/typst/packages/preview. 
See ![this](https://github.com/typst/packages?tab=readme-ov-file#local-packages) for more.
